# This is a modified Xplace

This repository holds a modified XPlace that removes features other than placement, while leaving the interface open for other tools to call. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/cuhk-eda/Xplace).

## About Xplace
Xplace is a fast and extensible GPU-accelerated global placement framework developed by the research team supervised by Prof. Evangeline F. Y. Young at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). It achieves around 3x speedup per GP iteration compared to DREAMPlace and shows high extensibility.
